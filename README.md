AI-Powered Story Generator (Storybot)This project is a simple, interactive web application that leverages the power of a large language model to generate custom stories. Users can specify an age group and a moral or theme, and the application will create a unique, engaging story tailored to their request.The application is built using Python with the Streamlit framework for the front end and integrates with the Groq API to access the llama-3.1-8b-instant model for story generation.Key FeaturesCustomizable Storytelling: Generate a story for any age group, from children to adults, with a specified moral or central theme.AI-Powered: Utilizes the high-performance llama-3.1-8b-instant model from Groq for fast and creative text generation.User-Friendly Interface: The Streamlit-based UI provides a simple and intuitive experience for users to input their story preferences.API Integration: Securely handles API key management to connect to the Groq API.Technologies UsedPython: The core programming language for the application logic.Streamlit: A powerful library for building and sharing data apps and web UIs.LangChain: Used to seamlessly integrate with the Groq API.Groq API: Provides access to the llama-3.1-8b-instant language model.Setup and InstallationPrerequisitesYou need a Groq API Key to run this application.
